# 👋Hey there, it's me, kingnes!
**`Digital Craftsman`**

I'm a software engineer who graduated from Saint-Petersburg State University of Telecommunications. I mostly do frontend development but also tried fullstack, building desktop apps and even tried to make games! I also have a YouTube channel [kingnes](https://www.youtube.com/@k1ngnes).

My main tech stack is React, Typescript and Tailwind. I really like frontend development, being able to make graphic user interface and connect it with a server is fantastic.

## My hobbies outside of software development:
  - Computer games
  - Video editing
  - Learning new languages
